Hello everyone, today we are going to discuss the issue regarding DDR Ratio.

It was discovered that the ratio on DP is quite high this week.

Does Martin know the reason?

I had night shift yesterday and handed over the matters to Lisa.

Who can explain the reason?

I'm here, no data radio.com.

Compared to the master part, figures such as temperature were considerably different.

Why was it easily altered?

Shouldn't the values align with the master copy?

Can I teach the system log to identify who made the change?
