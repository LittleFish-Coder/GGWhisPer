Hello everyone, today we are going to discuss the issue regarding DDR Ratio.

It was discovered that the ratio on DP is quite high this week. Does Martin know the reason?

"Es tut mir leid, ich hatte gestern night shift und habe die Angelegenheiten an Lisa übergeben. Er kann den Grund erklären." (I'm sorry, I had night shift yesterday and handed the matter over to Lisa. He can explain the reason.)

This week's TTR show is too high. The cause may be that the LC was changed. Compared with the buster parts, things like temperature and the cross were quite different.

Why was LC easily altered? Shouldn't the values align with the Master Copy? Can I teach the system log to identify who made the change?

"可以" (Yes/Okay/Can)

"我回去找一下資料" (I'll go back and look for the data.)

Additionally, can it upload the change data to DP? When someone does something unauthorized, it can print out the data and automatically send an alert email to the relevant personnel.

"好的" (Okay/Good)

"這件事技術上沒問題，但我需要回去和我老闆討論一下，你說得對，這屬於架構上的確，我這邊需要新增開放選項來抓漏的資料，sikary那邊也需要新增Table然後遺產行" (Technically, there's no problem with this, but I need to go back and discuss it with my boss. You're right, this is indeed an architectural matter. I need to add open options here to capture leaked data, and sikary needs to add a table for legacy rows.)

All right, please update me on this matter next time. Also, Martin, please investigate why EC was changed and update me next time. Thank you.

"Alles klar, ich werde die Angelegenheit weiter..." (All right, I will continue with the matter...)

That concludes today's meeting. Thank you, everyone.

"どん" (Dong/Thump/Sound of something dropping)

"ありがとうございます" (Thank you - Japanese)

Goodbye.
